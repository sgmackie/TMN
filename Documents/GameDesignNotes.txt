Narrative:

Why is Outer Wilds great? Uses large, high concepts but tells an emotional story
Don't want this game to feel completely cold, there should be an obvious, human element/tragedy driving the player from the start


Aesthetic:
Create an art mood board!
1910s Lovecratian/Alt history?
Ghost in the Shell cyberpunk?

Setting:
Kowloon City - megastructure you navigate through
Setting should be it's own character, mystery to how it operates

Gameplay Loop:
Thief/Hitman FPS stealth game
Limited ability set that can interact with the world in multiple ways

Ability to create a loop state in the world that plays back your actions (on a timer? how many states? on command?)
Each "level" is blocked by a gate - the gate wont open if you've used a loop state
Should be multiple paths to the gate

CONCERN - it feels like the player is being punished for using the loop states, the ability that will lead to cool,
emergant momements. Thinking about it, I don't think the gating idea will work
