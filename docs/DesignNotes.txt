Style:

Look at the Doom 3 code as a reference https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/01/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code-2/
const everything!


Patterns:

Systems should manage their own memory
Systems should provide handles to objects they manage (with options to convert to pointers) https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html
Handles are a struct during debug compiles for type safety, simple typedef in release builds
Always measure the size of structs! 
Encode object state in tags to avoid bools OR
Use seperate arrays for objects instead of checking state (e.g Alive and Dead NPCs in a level are two seperate arrays)
